Feature/&ClassWarlockEldritchInvocationAgnoizingBlastTitle Agonizing blast
Feature/&ClassWarlockEldritchInvocationAgnoizingBlastDescription This invocation does nothing, it's intended that you take the Agonizing blast cantrip at level 1 and this at level 2 since there doesn't seem to be a good way to override a cantrip in a casters list.

Adding in a whole new reaction choice on eldritch blast hitting would be crazy to implement.
